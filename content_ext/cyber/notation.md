I have long been looking for a notation to effectively write down tango steps and sequences.  Ideally, I would be able to send any tango teacher a text message or an email, and they would instantly know what sequence I had in mind and be able to answer my question.  This is what I’ve found so far:

*   [Hong Kong Tango Academy](https://web.archive.org/web/20110812162214/http://tangohk.com/learn_tango_step_by_step_%20P1.htm) — able to expressed in email, but very long notes to get across a single step.  Just take a look at the basic!
*   [Labanotation](https://web.archive.org/web/20110812162214/http://maagical.ch/andreasmaag/privat/tango) — Seems very complete, but doesn’t allow for the ease and flexibility of text-based systems.  How could one write to a friend or a teacher with a question?
*   [Tangotation](https://web.archive.org/web/20110812162214/http://www.easytango.com/dance/Tangotation#Examples) — Requires a three column system to be able to visually parse the letter sequence.  Plus, it’s really easy to get lost in the letters and have to look up more information.
*   [Rasche Notation](https://web.archive.org/web/20110812162214/http://www.tangolincs.co.uk/TangoLincs-Notation.htm) — Incorporates a complex grid of direction, angle, footwork, and musicality.  Very complete, but totally impossible to implement in any meaningful way without the special notebook.

Unfortunately, these are the only systems I’ve been able to find that are worth mention.  All of them are unsatisfactory in one way or another — does a good tango notation system exist?  Is there any way to relay tango sequences with a text-based system?
