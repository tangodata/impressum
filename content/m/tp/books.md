In the [Tango Mailing List](maillist_e.html) Victor Scarabino wrote a long list about Tango books which you will find appended here.
Enjoy reading, Garrit Fleischmann

Date: Mon, 8 Sep 1997

In this large message, I would wish to contribute with a selected bibliography about tango from both sides of the Rio de la Plata. Unfortunately for English speaking friends, most are in Spanish + 3 in French and I do not know about English editions (but some surely exists).

The list was mainly extracted from articles published in Uruguayan the journal "El Pais" (http://www.diarioelpais.com), with some personal additions. As you can see, most of the citations have a short summary.
Happy reading,
Cordially yours, Victor

### Tango books from Argentina and Uruguay (in Spanish)

1.  **TANGO. DISCUSSION AND KEY**
    by Ernesto Sabato. Ed. Losada. Bs. As. 1963. 167 pages.
    The essay by the Argentine writer that opens this book is actually called "Tango, song of Buenos Aires" and can also be read anthologized in his "Complete Works. Essays" (Grupo Editorial Planeta. Seix Barral. Bs. As. 1996; pages. 655 to 662). The core of the thesis proposed by the Cervantes Prize underlines the metaphysical transcendence of tango based on the definition of Enrique Santos Discepolo who saw it as "a sad thought that is danced." Sabato also analyzes here the erotic resentment present in tango and the deep drama of the bandoneon. The largest number of pages in the volume, however, goes to another work that, under his direction, was carried out by T. Di Paula, Noemi Lagos and Tulio Pizzini: "Anthology of Information and opinions on tango and its world" (pp. 27 to 150). The news and speculative baggage poured into this work represents an illuminating delivery in a global sense, multiple in terms of positions and foundations. The quotes involve - according to the chapters - voices such as Alfonsina Storni, Fernan Silva Valdes, Manuel Galvez, Horacio Arturo Ferrer, Daniel Vidart, Andre Gide, Tulio Carella, Vicente Rossi, Lauro Ayestaran, Jorge Luis Borges, Erasmo Silva (AVLIS), Carlos Maggi or Francisco Espinola. The thematic path goes from the alleged etymologies of the term "tango", the dark origins of the dance and the world of the compadrito to the relationship of the genre with popular theater and literature, the musical evolution between the Old Guard and the New Guard, the first rejection and the subsequent European apogee, without excluding, obviously: the myth of Gardel. In an appendix, a basic glossary of lunfarda voices is offered.

2.  **THIS IS HOW THE TANGOS**
    OF Francisco Garcia Jimenez WERE BORN. Ed. Losada. Buenos Aires. 1965. 260 pages.
    It is a compilation of sixty-three tango biographies originally published in the newspaper "El Dia" of La Plata, capital of the province of Buenos Aires. Published for the first time in 1945, this work by the journalist, comedian, film scriptwriter and author of several successful tangos (such as "Bajo Belgrano", "Alma en pena", "La ultima cita" or "Farolito de papel"), It collects not only the stories of music and lyrics but also draws individual and social profiles of a time of bohemianism in the hippodrome, little philosophers in the cafe and a lot of bellows in the cabaret or carnival dances. With an entertaining and didactic formula, they parade through chronicles - four pages long - paradigmatic titles such as "El choclo", "La morocha", "Mano a mano", "A media luz", "Caminito", !Leguisamo alone!", "Goodbye boys", "Anchor in Paris", "Sur" and of course, "La Cumparsita".

3.  **STORY OF CARLOS GARDEL TOLD BY JOSE RAZZANO**
    by Francisco Garcia Jimenez Buenos Aires, 1951 (?)

4.  **TANGO: HISTORY OF HALF A CENTURY**
    by Francisco Garcia Jimenez Buenos Aires, 1965

5.  **TANGO AND ITS WORLD**
    by Daniel Vidart. Taurus Editions. Montevideo. 1967. 210 pages.
    It is a classic of reviewed bibliography, often cited by researchers on both sides of the River Plate, in disagreement or agreement, as a basis or trigger for their own studies or reviews. The Sanducero anthropologist and "seven trades" of culture opens here the fans of his knowledge to transport the reader among the symbols, allegories and interpretations that tango provokes. He explains and describes the mythology of courage; He presents the literary process, the language and the themes of the tango song; he teaches prototypical environments and characters. And, obviously, he does not fail to open a chapter for Gardel: from myth to history, from Morocho del Abasto to Mago.

6.  **DISCEPOLIN AND ME**
    by Tania, by Jorge Miguel Couselo. Ed. La Bastille. Buenos Aires 1973; 146 pages.
    These are transcribed memories of the singer Anita Luciano Devis, born in Toledo in 1900 and known in El Plata since the late 1920s when she debuted with Roberto Firpo's orchestra, shortly before meeting Enrique Santos Discepolo, who would be her husband. for almost half a century, until he died. Believing or not believing in this case will be the reader's drama. The woman who wanted to play the "enfant terrible" in any gathering, she stamps on her part innumerable memories of herself without apparent fear of the criticism that she must have often heard regarding her continuous intention to overvalue herself. . However you interpret these pages dictated by a stubborn woman proud of her threshold-course, there are things to learn, others to make fun of and some to raise your eyebrows if you are Uruguayan, for example when in chapter nine, dedicated to travel stories, he confesses: "I don't know why I rarely mention Uruguay. Many times I performed in Montevideo, which I know like the backs of my hands. With Enrique we spent the summer in Punta del Este, working or just relaxing. Uruguay never stops be a little bit Argentine." Whatever the reader's reception may also be, it is clear that Discepolo was a philosophical artist who flirted with loneliness and became embattled with Peron, while Tania modeled with her own being a diva who would spend her life dreaming of doing business. The book includes, along with half a dozen photos, a complete discography of the singer.

7.  **REPORT ON SOSA**
    by Federico Silva. Plaza Ed. Montevideo. 1985. 77 pages.
    It is the third biographical book dedicated by the renowned tango journalist and composer to notable figures of typical music. The trilogy opened with the "Report on Gardel" and continued with the "Report on Troilo." As in the previous works, in this "Report on Sosa" the profile of the idol is pursued - through notes - from his humble Canarian origins in the Carlitos Gilardoni orchestra until the hours of his agony, after the accident. automobile accident suffered by the singer at the wheel of a red DKW. The book also includes an interview with Armando Pontier, a complete discography of the performer, and twenty photographs. The author's conclusion says that Julio Sosa was the Gardel of his generation.

8.  **TANGO AND ITS CIRCUMSTANCES**
    by Fernando O. Assuncao. Ed. El Ateneo. Buenos Aires. 1984. 307 pages.
    The well-known Montevideo professor and scholar in areas such as cultural anthropology and social history, traces in this book all his erudition on a topic that spans between the years 1880 and 1920. More than his own research, this time it is a large inventory of knowledge collected and interpreted--that is--from a personal point of view. The analysis turns to the events that conditioned to a greater or lesser extent the gestation and development of tango in light of the "change or acute angle of flexion that marks the moment." The volume is divided into four books; the first is dedicated to the prehistory of tango (popular couple dances of the 18th and 19th centuries); the second addresses the behavior of society and the consequences in popular culture; The third includes, among other ingredients, the musical, choreographic and poetic aspects of tango in its dawn; and finally, the fourth book expands on the treatment of the Old Guard and the universalization of tango. From this period and as a yapa, a brief anthology of musicians is added, from Anselmo Aieta to Luis Teisseire\* \*

9.  **I KILL RODRIGUEZ. THE ONE WITH THE BIRTHDAY**
    by Rosario Infantozzi Duran. Plaza Ed. Montevideo, 1992. 136 pages.
    It is in its third edition and is a generous journey around the life of Becho, the author's great-uncle and glorious author of the world tango anthem. The particularity of the text consists of being the product of a biographical investigation that actually appears in the form of an autobiography. The simple and stark prose projects both the preambles of the Montevideo carnivals in which the trouppes were all the rage, and the crazy years of the world, for example of a Montmartre invaded by plush galleys and fox-trots. At the same time, he also confesses the role of black sheep that Don Gerardo had within his family, his wandering and irreverent profile (from Buenos Aires to Barcelona), his passion for racehorses and elegant women but with complex "status." , their "vampiric" binges, their streaks of "normal madness" and their financial vicissitudes regarding success and the chain of contracts sponsored by "La Cumparsita." The book provides, among more illustrations, a dozen drawings by Pepe Infantozzi and another similar number of substantial photographs of the period lived by the Uruguayan musician, composer of other classics such as "Che papusa, oi", "Margarita punzo" or "Mocosita" . The prologue, which is titled "Journey into a Master", is signed by Horacio Ferrer. The Uruguayan poet, author of "Balada para un loco", "La ultima grela", "Chiquilin de Bachin" and the avant-garde opera "Maria de Buenos Aires" (a duet with Piazzolla), says for example: Rosario knew how to put himself at the ready of being the tenacious magnet who obtained from the hands of his uncle Jorge Duran Matos the suitcase in which Matos Rodriguez's mother would keep all her most intimate belongings when he died. Suitcase that for forty-two years she was kept 'in the darkest corner of a dark basement'. From that suitcase, Rosario's luggage on her extraordinary journey, she takes everything: letters, documents, writings, photographs, newspaper clippings and, of course, tiny traces of charisma, crystals of salt from tears, cream of dreams, still bright splinters of secret and layered laughter. With all of this, harmonized with the purified whispers, the confirmed anecdotes and a complete hunt for the family declaration, Rosario restores the style of Matos Rodriguez, descending into the well without bottom or contour of the spirit that calls her.

10.  **THIS IS HOW LA CUMPARSITA WAS BORN**
    by Alberto Alonso, Ed. Mosca, Montevideo 1967
    History of the Tango Hymn and its author

11.  **CARLOS GARDEL -- OPEN PAGES**
    by Eduardo Paysee Gonzalez. Distribuidora Oriental de Ediciones, 1993. 471 pages.
    The original volume (because the second edition was not a simple reprint but a work to open new paths), took shape in Mexico, where the Uruguayan lawyer and essayist resided between 1981 and 1990, not only focused on studies and dissemination of popular topics but also devoted to issues of international politics and economics. Among the objectives of the monumental undertaking around tango and its maximum voice, the author decides to break with "created interests and with mistimed modesty", starting from the "first sources of man "surrounded by "misery, mud, human weaknesses." Such an effort also contemplates the need to revive the "double death, physical and mythical, unfolded image, human foundation of the wonderful artist." From the presentation, the interest in avoiding the beaten paths and the intellectual laziness that led many to erase contradictory documentation at a stroke. Without aspiring to clear up all the unknowns, however, the author does not abandon himself to half-measures either. Among other things, he subscribes to the thesis that states that Gardel was born in Tacuarembo in 1887 or a few years before and then became an Argentine national.

12.  **THE EASTERN SHORE OF TANGO -- HISTORY OF URUGUAYAN TANGO**
    by Juan Carlos Legido. Plaza Editions. Testimonials Collection. Montevideo, 1994. 187 pages.
    Although it does not have a national scope in the strict sense but rather a Montevideo one, this book carries the irreplaceable flavor of being the first that addresses with profuse data and systematically what happened in the genre on this side of the River Plate (something previously outlined in a "Brief history... ." by Ovidio Cano published in 1966). Its author, a teacher of Literature and Art History and also an award-winning writer of fictional prose, now thoroughly reiterates what he had already proven both in his profile as a poet and playwright and in his work. investigative and essayistic focused on a didactic history of the Uruguayan Theater: neither more nor less than his passionate taste for tango. The reader, meanwhile, will be able to discover - through several short chapters - from an oral version of the birth of tango in Uruguay to an overview of the Montevideo tanguerias of the nineties that are current; anecdotes from the first Uruguayan groups; stories of crazy years and trouppes; bohemian and coffee adventures or institutional worries; appearance of stamps and records, etc.

13.  **CARLOS GARDEL. THE SILENCE OF TACUAREMBO**
    by Maria Selva Ortiz. Plaza Ed. Montevideo. 1995. 75 pages.
    In this book - which is already being sold in its fourth edition - the birth of Gardel in Tacuarembo is taken as proven and it goes on - from the field of socioanalysis - to fundamentally narrate the climate of mysterious concealment that a town almost It held for decades, at least without problems until the sixties, a time in which El Pais journalist Erasmo Silva Cabrera (AVLIS) penetrated the retaining walls of that collective secret that encouraged very cautious or false testimonies, always warned of not to remove the true story of the almost incestuous relationship of the Political and Police Chief Colonel Escayola with his goddaughter and sister-in-law Maria Lelia Oliva, a 14-year-old girl. This monographic work has the peculiarity of being written by a young sociologist who does not She is not a devotee of Gardel nor of tango.

14.  **TANGO IN GRAPHIC AND WRITTEN HUMOR**
    by Oscar Vazquez Lucio (SIULNAS). Ed. Tango Club. Buenos Aires. 1995.
    The title of this small book summarizes its contents very well. It is a survey of texts and images that transmit a map of humorous inspirations from the clear melancholy projected by the tango, "a milonga that is in no hurry" - in the words of Jorge Palacio (Faruk).

15.  **ALFREDO LE PERA -- THE BRAZILIAN POET OF GARDEL**
    by Martin Correa. Imp. Tradinco. Montevideo, 1995. 122 pages.
    The author of these pages, (a veteran journalist who in our environment works in the press, radio and television), maintains that Gardel's poet was born in San Pablo (a fact already reiterated in works by other researchers) in 1900 (a more controversial fact since different dates have been handled, although close: 1902-1904). The figure of who was the librettist of all the Gardelian films since 1932 - including the songs of such films, without lunfardisms, more appropriate to an international image, for example "Volver" or "El dia que me Quiero"--, is here rescued from the darkness where the legend located him from which he was accused of Gardel's death, or rather: for the attempt to kill him by shooting a bullet that would have ended up hitting the pilot's neck in the accident. Medellin aviation on June 24, 1935.

16.  **REPATRIATION OF GARDEL**
    by Ricardo Ostuni. Ed. Tango Club with the sponsorship of the National Tango Academy. Argentina, 1995. 316 pages.
    The Argentine poet and city researcher aims in this work to expose and analyze "the plurality of unknowns not resolved by the official history of Carlos Gardel" and then "refute many of his arguments." Ostuni also starts from something pointed out by the Uruguayan writer Carlos Maggi: "it is a known fact that each country favors its inhabitants by the mere fact of being born on it... We are born with two cows, a mate and Carlos Gardel." The value of the work is summarized in the prologue in the words of Arturo Ferrer: "wisely bony and acetic in conception, architecture and language."

17.  **THE TANGO**
    by Idea Vilarino. Ed. Cal y Canto. Montevideo. 1995. 146 pages.
    Originality and rigor are two words that at this point may sound like mere fancy adjectives, especially if the proposed topic is tango, already approached from almost every possible angle. For this book, however, originality and rigor are fair qualifications in themselves and also adequate to alert the reader to the interest of an essay that is not the first written by the author on the subject of tango but that summarizes and expands the previous ones. Along with the anthology of tango lyrics that the Uruguayan poet herself creates in the second half of the volume, the project opens with an exhaustive and stimulating analysis of the writing, the themes and motifs, the literary forms and the influences. Next, the arbitrary but effective task of selecting ten authors valued as poets of the genre is addressed: Pascual Contursi, Celedonio E. Flores, Manuel Romero, Enrique Cadicamo, Francisco Garcia Gimenez, Enrique Santos Discepolo, Jose Maria Contursi, Catulo Castillo, Homero Exposito and Homero Manzi.

18.  **THE GOLDEN BOOK OF TANGO DE CLARIN**
    by Juan Colino. Mera Editor. Montevideo. Three volumes: March-June-October, 1996.
    The idea arose on CX 58, the leading tango radio station for the "Plata Basin." It proposes an edition of classic songs of the genre, all accompanied by a brief impressionist commentary and very brief biographical notes on the composers. Each volume averages 150 pages and can be considered - as the author himself does - a radio book, to be consulted with a bandoneon in the background and while drinking coffee. The River Plate itinerary goes from Enrique Santos Discepolo to Enrique Cadicamo from "Mi noche triste" to "Balada para un loco." Volume 3 (illustrated with photographs and not with drawings by Rolando Salvatore like the previous two) incorporates - like other novelties - a note that traces archaic tangos and the primitive environments of dance, an interview with Donato Racciatti and another with the legendary Marito, still a Fun-Fun waiter today. Regarding Gardel's mysteries, in this case we choose to leave them "in the mist."

19.  **ANTHOLOGY OF TANGO**
    by Alfredo Gravina. Ed. Projection. Montevideo. 1996. 210 pages.
    In this work, tango lyrics are gathered based on three selective purposes that consider aesthetic quality, the socio-economic reference and the good degree of popularity. The gallery of texts is arranged chronologically according to the names of the authors; It starts with Amadori and ends with Zuviria.

20.  **GARDEL AND THE SPEECH OF THE URUGUAYANS**
    by Eduardo Buela. Plaza Editions. Montevideo. 1996, 64 pages.
    This monographic work received First Prize in the competition held in 1995 by the National Academy of Letters. Its author, who from the first paragraph admits not to be a linguist, patiently analyzes Gardel's songbook composed of 759 different songs (among them 514 tangos), recorded on disc from 1913 (Buenos Aires) to 1935 (New York), passing through which was also recorded in Barcelona and Paris. With the support of a first-rate bibliography, he points out - more than Uruguayanisms - "the imprint of our everyday popular speech, when it was inserted in the extensive Gardelian repertoire." Thus, curiosities arise at every step, such as the mention of the word "botija" (oriental emblem in front of the "pibe" of Buenos Aires) only in two tangos, written by Argentines: "Pan comido" and "Paquetin, paqueton." The selection of demonstrative words and verses is divided into two blocks; one for 107 "urban" cases and another for 37 "countryside" cases.

21.  **REPORT ON TANGO**
    by Nelson Bayardo. Plaza Editions. Testimonials Collection. Montevideo. 1996. 110 pages.
    The Uruguayan architect and professor summarizes the initial eras and the most glorious eras of the world of tango in relation to social and cultural factors of unquestionable incidence, for example, the mainly male immigration that led to the emergence and success of brothels, places "where The erotic game found in tango an effective prologue for its purposes, given the sexographic nature of the dance", although as has already been pointed out, these were not the only venues for the dance, but rather one type among several, that is to say: academies, piringundines and tenements. Along with the illustrations of Justino Serralta and the author's sober pen, there is of course no shortage of chapters to synthesize biographical data of musicians of all times; typical characters from the tango repertoire such as mines and compadritos; instruments such as guitar, piano and bandoneon; authors, singers, lyrics and lunfardisms treated in a special glossary.

22.  **BOOK OF TANGO**
    by Horacio Ferrer, published in Buenos Aires in 1977
    For the most fanatical reader who wants everything, you have at your disposal the spectacular, originally in two mammoth and luxurious volumes, also distributed in Montevideo in a new edition of a single volume but not less shocking.

23.  **TANGO --A DEFINITIVE GUIDE**
    by Horacio Salas. Aguilar--with the sponsorship of the National Tango Academy and the Portena del Lunfardo Academy. Buenos Aires. 1996. 348 pages.
    Poet, essayist and journalist of recognized career, Salas expands with this editorial product a previous book published in 1986, titled "El Tango" and basically articulated to propose a social history of Buenos Aires music. Now, it is a vast dictionary, not only of figures linked to the world of two by four (composers, singers, musicians) but also of themes, words, instruments, radio companies, cafes, dance houses, prototypical tangos, famous brothels , orchestras, etc. Very Argentine indeed, out of pride and historical truth, the project is still generous with the Uruguayans and thus includes several files of masters in their areas, such as Carlos Roldan, Vicente Rossi, Victor Solino, Julio Sosa, Horacio Ferrer and Carlos Gardel of whom, even when all the voices and "mysteries" are compiled, it ends by maintaining: "if it is true that in Abasto they called him El Francesito, it is also true that in all his documents and among friends, he said he was Uruguayan. This is how he appears in his Argentine enrollment book, with individual registration number 236,001, where he declares to be a native of Tacuarembo". As if that were not enough, in addition to numerous illustrations and photographs, the book includes a prologue by Enrique Cadicamo, lists of Argentine films focused on tango and also dance lessons, so that no one comes out saying that they can't handle boleo or quebrada. Furthermore, sufficient material for those who seek to have an orientation when finding style brands or main protagonists, whether from orthodoxy or from the tango avant-garde.
    The **French edition** of this book was published by Ed. Actes Sud, Arles, France in 1986
