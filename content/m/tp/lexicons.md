**Gerneral Tango Terms**

A type of african-origin music with a marked rhythm played on a "tamboril" (kind of drum). dance where an embraced couple perform a series of (sometimes intricate) patterns primarily with their legs, to the rhythm of tango m

Direct descendant of the Candombe, Habanera, Milonga, and (by some tango scholars) the Tango Andaluz.

The place where the blacks congregated to dance to the rhythm of drums.

(Note: entire books and lives have been dedicated to the search for the ultimate definition or origin of the word "tango", i.e., this is only a minimal subset of the available definitions.)

Milonguero

A man who likes to attend the milongas.

A person whose life revolves around dancing tango and the philosophy of tango.

Payador pueblero (traveling folk-music singer.)

A title given _by other tango dancers_ to a man who has mastered the tango dance and embodies the essence of the tango.

Milonguera

Female dancer (for hire) of the early dance halls, cabarets, and nightclubs.

A woman who likes to attend the milongas.

A woman whose life revolves around dancing tango and the philosophy of tango.

A title given _by other tango dancers_ to a woman who has mastered the tango dance and embodies the essence of the tango.

Milonguita: A woman of loose morals, often times a prostitute.

Tango Liso

A way of dancing tango characterized by its lack of fancy figures or patterns. Only the most "basic" tango steps and figures are utilized, e.g., caminadas, ochos, molinetes, etc. Ganchos, sacadas, boleos and other fancy moves (such as leaps, sentadas, and all acrobatics in general) are not done.

Tango de Salon

A way of dancing tango characterized by slow measured moves. It includes all of the "basic" tango steps and figures plus some sacadas, giros, and low boleos. The emphasis is on precision. The dancing couple remains at a "proper" distance from each other, i.e., their bodies are \*not\* in a close embrace. This is what happened to the tango when the French and the English got a hold of it in the early part of the century (pre-World War I) :^) This is the style of dance that most people who run milongas wish people did, and the style most dancers wish the \*other\* dancers did... :^)

the terms 'Tango de Salon' and 'Tango Milonguero' seem to be interpreted differently by different dancers and teacher, so one should be aware that other people might think of something different when they talk about 'Tango de Salon'

Tango Danza

Tango dance (in Spanish).

Tango for Export

A way of dancing tango much derided by the milongueros of Buenos Aires. It's a tango without soul. This is a tango that plays well in the cabarets of Paris, New York, Berlin, or Tokyo because most of what made it a Porte~no dance (one that spoke directly to the soul of the Argentino) has been stripped away, leaving only the fancy moves and pseudo passion for the enjoyment of an exotic- loving public.

Tango Fantasia

This a hybrid tango. An amalgam of traditional tango steps and ballet, ballroom, gymnastics, ice-skating figures, etc. This is what most people see when they buy tickets for a tango show. The moves include all of the basic tango moves plus, ganchos, sacadas, boleos of every kind, sentadas, kicks, leaps, spins, and anything else that the choreographer and the performers think they can get away with. The music played might not even be a "real" tango, i.e., it can be Jazz, a bastardized classical piece, etc. Alas, this is the style of dancing most prevalent at the milongas outside of the Rio de la Plata region. Usually badly performed by ill-behaved tango dancers and frustrated tango performers who insist in getting their money's worth at the milonga even if they have to kick, step, bump into, or trip every other dancer on the floor.

Tango Orillero

Orillero means "of the outskirts". Thus, this was a style of dancing tango that was "outside" of the prevalent way of dancing. Nowadays, is more defined by its quick moves, kicks, and acrobatics. See "Juan Bruno" for more details.... ;-)

So far, the definitions for these general Tango terms are from _Caran Fanfunfa_ (Thanks for your work!)
You are all invited to add further definitions to this list.
